# KarpathyNeuralNetworks

This is a walk through of the excellent Andrej Karpathy [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) video series on youtube.

I am using the conda environment 'nlpwt' for this repository.

I initially began this notebook yesterday, using docker container heuristic_kilby, but was unable to get the graphviz stuff running, so I switched to the 'nlpwt' conda environment. 

### 6:25pm 

Done the first video, [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) I am really glad I went through the process of really watching this video and coding it out myself!
